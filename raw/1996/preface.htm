<H3><body bgcolor="#ffffff" <STRONG>ELECTION RESULTS FOR THE U.S.
PRESIDENT, THE U.S. SENATE AND THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</STRONG>
</H3>
<HR>

<P>
This publication has been prepared by the Federal Election Commission
to provide the public with the results of elections held in the
fifty states during 1996 for the offices of United States President,
United States Senator and United States Representative. Also included
are the results for Delegate to Congress from American Samoa,
the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Resident
Commissioner in Puerto Rico. In addition, there are results for
the elections to fill the unexpired Senate term in Kansas, the
unexpired House of Representatives term in Missouri, and the special
general and run-off elections in Texas. The Commission undertakes
this project on a biennial basis in order to respond to public
inquiries.
<P>
The elections for the office of United States Senator and United
States Representative are administered by local election officials
in towns, counties, municipalities, and other jurisdictions. The
results of the elections are certified by the state government,
which in most cases is the Secretary of State. While the full
records are available for public inspection, most states prepare
summary reports for public dissemination. These summary reports
vary in form and content, and may be amended well after the election.
There is no standard format that states use in reporting federal
election results.
<P>
Recognizing a need to bring together in one place the Federal
election results, the Commission presents this publication as
the eighth in a series designed to provide an accurate, historical
record of Federal election results. Included in this publication
are the official results of primary elections and run-off elections
held in 1996. As in the case of the general elections, primary
elections are not administered by the federal government. In some
states (such as Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia), political party
organizations control their nomination process by way of conventions.
In other states, state law may regulate the primary and/or its
administration.
<P>
Data is based on official figures provided by State election officials,
and includes results amended through May 1997. If the election
results are modified in the future, the Commission will supply
errata supplements as necessary.
<P>
The assistance provided by the State election officials and their
staff in gathering this data is greatly appreciated. This publication
has been prepared as a research tool for Commission staff and
State election offices. Additional copies may be ordered from
the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department
of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161.

<B>EXPLANATORY NOTES</B> 
<UL>
<LI>The candidate who was the winner of the general election is
listed first in each state and district entry. After that, the
candidates are arranged by party affiliation. The party affiliation
of the candidate has been abbreviated. A complete listing of party
abbreviations appears at the end of this publication.<BR>

<LI>Total for write-in votes are shown as disclosed by the state.
Some states list the names of candidates who received write-in
votes, while others provide a write-in vote total without the
names of the candidates who received the votes. Still other states
combine these two variations and provide the names of some candidates
who received write-in votes and a total of write-in votes for
all the other candidates.<BR>

<LI>&quot;Total Votes,&quot; &quot;Total Party Votes&quot; and
&quot;Total District Votes&quot; represent all the valid votes
cast for the candidates in the election.<BR>

<LI>The percentage of votes received by each candidate is based
on the figure of total votes. The percentage of votes received
by each candidate in a primary or run-off election is based on
the figure of total votes cast in that specific primary or run-off
election.<BR>

<LI>Due to the rounding of percentage numbers, some percentages
may not total 100%.<BR>

<STRONG>NOTES ON CHARTS</STRONG> 
<UL>
<LI>In Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, political parties may nominate
general election candidates by party convention, rather than by
primary election. Convention vote is not included in primary election
vote totals.<BR>

<LI>Runoff election vote totals have been included with the primary
election totals. For Texas and the Virgin Islands, runoff election
vote totals have been included with the general election totals.
