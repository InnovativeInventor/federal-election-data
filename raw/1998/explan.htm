<blockquote>
  </font><ul>
    <li>The candidate who was the winner of the general election is listed first in each state
      and district entry. After that, the candidates are arranged by party affiliation.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Incumbent candidates facing re-election in 1998 are designated with an (I) to the left
      of the candidate&#146;s name. The lack of an (I) in a particular Senate race or U.S. House
      district indicates an open seat race.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The party affiliation of the candidate has been abbreviated. A complete listing of party
      abbreviations appears at the end of this publication.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Total for write-in votes are shown as disclosed by the state. Some states list the names
      of candidates who received write-in votes, while others provide a write-in vote total
      without the names of the candidates who received the votes. Still other states combine
      these two variations and provide the names of some candidates who received write-in votes
      and a total of write-in votes for all the other candidates.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Convention votes, where shown, are as disclosed by the state parties.<br>
    </li>
    <li>&quot;Total Votes,&quot; Total Party Votes&quot; and &quot;Total District Votes&quot;
      represents all the valid votes cast for the candidates in the election.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The percentage of votes received by each candidate is based on the figure of total
      votes. The percentage of votes received by each candidate in a primary or run-off election
      is based on the figure of total votes cast in that specific primary or run-off election.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Due to the rounding of percentage numbers, some percentages may not total 100%.</li>
  </ul>
  <b><p><u>Notes on Charts</u></b><ul>
    <li>In Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, political parties may nominate general election
      candidates by party convention, rather than by primary election. Convention vote is not
      included in primary election vote totals.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Runoff election vote totals have been included with the primary election totals. (For
      the U.S. Senate, runoff elections were held in Arkansas and Oklahoma. For the U.S. House
      of Representatives, runoff elections were held in Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina
      and Texas.)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Blank spaces in the charts may indicate that there were unopposed candidates whose names
      did not appear on a ballot and therefore received no votes, or that there was not a
      particular primary or general election in that state or for that office. Please refer to
      the individual state pages for further explanation.</li>
