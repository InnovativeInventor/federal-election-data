<p><b>*</b> In July 1998, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the
action of the District Court in the case of Love, et al v. Foster and McKeithen (remanded
from the U.S. Supreme Court), which established November 3, 1998, as the date of the 1998
Congressional election with a runoff to be held on December 5, 1998, if necessary. The
ruling preserved all provisions of the current state election code with the exception of
the provisions which establish the dates on which members of Congress are elected. </p>

<p>Section 511 of Title 18 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, as amended, provides
that a candidate who receives a majority of votes cast for an office in a primary election
is elected. When no candidate achieves a majority, the two top vote-getters, regardless of
party, go on to a runoff election. This section also provides that a candidate who is
unopposed in the primary is declared elected by the people and is not listed on the ballot
in either the primary or general election. In 1998, the runoff election, scheduled for
December 5, 1998, was not necessary. </p>
