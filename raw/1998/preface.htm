<p ALIGN="CENTER">ELECTION RESULTS FOR THE U.S. SENATE</font></b><br>
<b><font SIZE="4">AND THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
</font></b>

<p>This publication has been prepared by the Federal Election Commission to provide the
public with the results of elections held in the fifty states during 1998 for the office
of United States Senator and United States Representative. Also, there are results for
Delegate to Congress from American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam and the Virgin
Islands. There was no election for Resident Commissioner in Puerto Rico as their election
is held every four years and coincides with the Presidential election. The Commission
undertakes this project on a biennial basis in order to respond to public inquiries.</p>

<p>The elections for the office of United States Senator and United States Representative
are administered by local election officials in towns, counties, municipalities, and other
jurisdictions. The results of the elections are certified by the state government, which
in most cases is the Secretary of State. While the full records are available for public
inspection, most states prepare summary reports for public dissemination. These summary
reports vary in form and content, and may be amended well after the election. There is no
standard format that states use in reporting federal election results.</p>

<p>Recognizing a need to bring together in one place the federal election results, the
Commission presents this publication as the ninth in a series designed to provide an
accurate, historical record of federal election results.</p>

<p>Included in this publication are the official results of primary elections and run-off
elections held in 1998. As in the case of the general elections, primary elections are not
administered by the federal government. In some states (such as Connecticut, Utah, and
Virginia), political party organizations control their nomination process by way of
conventions. In other states, state law may regulate the primary and/or its
administration.</p>

<p>Data is based on official figures provided by State election officials, and includes
results amended through April 1999<i>. </i>The assistance provided by the State election
officials and their staff in gathering this data is greatly appreciated. Special thanks is
also given to R. Bryan Whitener in the Commission&#146;s Public Disclosure Division for
the invaluable assistance he provided in compiling the data for this publication.</p>

<p>This publication has been prepared as a research tool for Commission staff and State
election offices. Additional copies may be ordered from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia
